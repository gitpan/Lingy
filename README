NAME
    Lingy - A Programming Language for Acmeist Modules

SYNOPSIS
        > lingy --to=perl6 module.ly.yaml

DESCRIPTION
    Lingy is a programming language, but not in the typical sense. It has no
    syntax and it has no runtime. The main point of Lingy is generate
    equivalent code in many popular programming languages.

    Lingy defines the internal structure of a program. A program in Lingy is
    a well defined data structure. The data structure contains all the
    information necessary to produce equivalent "real" code in many
    langauges.

    Programs in Lingy are graphs in memory. They can serialized, thus they
    can conceptually be *written* using a serialization like YAML. However
    any syntax that can compile to a valid Lingy data structure, is a valid
    Lingy syntax. Thus it is intended that Lingy will have many syntaxes.

    One syntax that is being developed in parallel is called CafeScript. You
    can think of it as a language like CoffeeScript, except that instead of
    just compiling to one language, it compiles to many languages (including
    JavaScript).

    Lingy is currently targeting class-based OO languages, like Perl, Ruby,
    Python, PHP and JavaScript.
