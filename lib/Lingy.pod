=head1 NAME

Lingy - A Programming Language for Acmeist Modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    > lingy --to=perl6 module.ly.yaml

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lingy is a programming language, but not in the typical sense. It has no
syntax and it has no runtime. The main point of Lingy is generate equivalent
code in many popular programming languages.

Lingy defines the internal structure of a program. A program in Lingy is a
well defined data structure. The data structure contains all the information
necessary to produce equivalent "real" code in many langauges.

Programs in Lingy are graphs in memory. They can serialized, thus they can
conceptually be I<written> using a serialization like YAML. However B<any>
syntax that can compile to a valid Lingy data structure, is a valid Lingy
syntax. Thus it is intended that Lingy will have many syntaxes.

One syntax that is being developed in parallel is called CafeScript. You can
think of it as a language like CoffeeScript, except that instead of just
compiling to one language, it compiles to many languages (including
JavaScript).

Lingy is currently targeting class-based OO languages, like Perl, Ruby,
Python, PHP and JavaScript.
